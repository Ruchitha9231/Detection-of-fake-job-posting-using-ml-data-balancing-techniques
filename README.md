Fake job postings have become an increasingly common online crisis now-a-days, exploiting the money or identities of individuals seeking employment via online platforms. Genuine job postings are more in number compared to fake job postings; this imbalanced nature of the data makes it even harder to detect the fake job postings. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying fraudulent job postings by applying various data balancing techniques to counteract the class imbalance inherent in the dataset in combination with various state-of-art machine learning techniques. Methods like TF-IDF, categorical data is utilized for feature extraction and the impact of multiple balancing strategies, including SMOTE- NC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous), Cluster-Based Oversampling (Cluster- SMOTE), for data augmentation, and cost-sensitive learning is analyzed. After applying these techniques, we use several types of machine learning models on obtained balanced datasets. Comparative analysis of various machine learning models used is performed along with the corresponding data balancing technique used. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of various balancing techniques in improving model performance, offering a more robust solution to combat online frauds like fake job postings.
